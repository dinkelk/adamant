description: This is a unit test suite for the crc 16 algorithm
tests:
  - name: Test_Crc
    description: This test sends in a bit pattern and validates that the correct CRC is returned.
  - name: Test_Crc_Seeded
    description: This test sends in a bit scattered pattern and validates that the correct CRC is returned.
  - name: Test_Crc_Empty
    description: This test verifies that CRC of an empty array returns the seed unchanged.
  - name: Test_Crc_Single_Byte
    description: This test verifies CRC computation on a single-byte input.
  - name: Test_Crc_All_Zeros
    description: This test verifies CRC computation on an all-zeros input.
  - name: Test_Crc_All_Ones
    description: This test verifies CRC computation on an all-0xFF input.
  - name: Test_Crc_Pointer
    description: This test verifies the Byte_Array_Pointer overload produces the same result as the array overload.
