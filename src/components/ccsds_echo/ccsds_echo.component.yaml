description: This component creates Adamant packets whose data is the CCSDS packets sent to it. The main use of this component is to echo a CCSDS stream from uplink back down as downlink. Note that this component has no enable/disable command interface by design; echo suppression is intended to be handled at the assembly level by disconnecting or not connecting the component. This keeps the component simple and stateless for maximum reusability.
