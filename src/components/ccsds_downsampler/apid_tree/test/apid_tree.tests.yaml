description: This is a unit test suite for the apid tree object for help with the ccsds_downsampler
tests:
  - name: Test_Init_List
    description: This test is intended to test the different permutations of the init of the apid and filter factor type array.
  - name: Test_Set_Filter_Factor
    description: This unit test tests changing the value of the filter factor for a given apid.
  - name: Test_Get_Counters
    description: This unit test makes sure the counters for the number of packets that should be passed or filtered are correct.
  - name: Test_Counter_Saturation
    description: This test verifies that Num_Passed_Packets and Num_Filtered_Packets saturate at Unsigned_16'Last instead of wrapping around to 0, and that Filter_Count uses modular arithmetic correctly.
