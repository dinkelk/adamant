description: This is a unit test suite for the apid tree object for help with the ccsds_downsampler
tests:
  - name: Test_Init_List
    description: This test is intended to test the different permutations of the init of the apid and filter factor type array.
  - name: Test_Set_Filter_Factor
    description: This unit test tests changing the value of the filter factor for a given apid.
  - name: Test_Get_Counters
    description: This unit test makes sure the counters for the number of packets that should be passed or filtered are correct.
  - name: Test_Filter_Count_Overflow
    description: This test exercises Filter_Count behavior across the former Unsigned_16 wrap-around boundary to verify correct pass/filter patterns over 65536+ calls.
  - name: Test_Counter_Overflow
    description: This test exercises global Num_Passed_Packets and Num_Filtered_Packets counter behavior near Unsigned_16 overflow.
  - name: Test_Empty_Init_List
    description: This test initializes the tree with an empty list and verifies all APIDs return Invalid_Id.
  - name: Test_Single_Element_Init_List
    description: This test initializes the tree with a single element list to test the boundary case for the binary tree.
