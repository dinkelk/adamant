description:
  The CCSDS downsampler filters packets based on a configurable downsample list. Each entry in the list pairs an APID with a filter factor that controls how often packets of that APID are forwarded.
  Internally, a protected binary tree maps each APID to its filter factor and a running count. When a packet arrives, its APID is looked up in the tree. If the count is a multiple of the filter factor, the packet is passed through; otherwise it is filtered. A filter factor of 0 filters all packets for that APID. A filter factor of 1 passes all packets.
  Packets whose APID is not in the downsample list are always forwarded unfiltered.
  The binary tree lookup time grows with the number of entries. It is recommended that the downsample list contain fewer than 200 entries.
